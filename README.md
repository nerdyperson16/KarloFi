# KarloFi
Personal Project - KarloPi (3 and above) and a PIR Motion Sensor allows you to detect motion in a certain area and turns on your LoFi music or certain song through YouTube.


This project is only a personal project as I learn Python and the Raspberry Pi. I really needed music but didn't want to yell at my Google Home to play my Spotify, or turn on my phone to play music.

You will need to setup the Raspberry Pi using Raspbian with Desktop. A PIR motion sensor is required for this setup. Mozilla Firefox (as of V1.1), is required for this setup to work correctly. You'll also need to autostart the application if you would like it to run headless without an IDE, or a terminal, to run the program.
