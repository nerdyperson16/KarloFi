# KarloFi
Personal Project - KarloPi (3 and above) and a PIR Motion Sensor allows you to detect motion in a certain area and turns on your LoFi music or certain song through YouTube.


This project is only a personal project as I learn Python and the Raspberry Pi. I really needed music but didn't want to yell at my Google Home to play my Spotify, or turn on my phone to play music.
